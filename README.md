# C Programming Projects Repository

This repository contains various C programming projects that can be used as reference material or as starting points for your own projects.

## Projects

### CircularBuffer

A circular buffer (also known as a ring buffer) is a data structure that uses a fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This project provides a circular buffer implementation in C.

### HashTable

A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. This project provides a hash table implementation in C.

### HelloWorld

The traditional "Hello, World!" program in C.

### List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, and all the elements are connected using pointers. This project provides a linked list implementation in C.

### Queue

A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and removal from the other end of the sequence. This project provides a queue implementation in C.

### input_output

A collection of examples demonstrating input and output in C.

### pointers

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. This project provides examples of pointer usage in C.

### vpn

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. This project provides a VPN implementation in C.
